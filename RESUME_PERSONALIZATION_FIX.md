# Resume-Based Question Generation Fix

## Problem
The interview application was generating the same questions for all candidates regardless of their resume content, making the interview experience generic rather than personalized.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Insufficient Resume Content Integration**: The AI prompt included resume text but didn't strongly emphasize generating unique questions based on specific resume details.

2. **Generic Focus Areas**: The system relied too heavily on predefined skill matchers instead of analyzing unique resume content.

3. **Inadequate Resume Parsing**: Limited text truncation and weak personalization signals in AI prompts.

4. **Incorrect OpenAI API Format**: The service was using an incorrect API call format that caused failures.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI Question Generation (`aiService.js`)

**Changes Made:**
- **Improved System Prompt**: Now explicitly instructs AI to generate questions "SPECIFICALLY tailored to their unique background, projects, companies, and experiences"
- **Enhanced Context Extraction**: Added function to extract company names, project keywords, and specific technologies from resume text
- **Increased Resume Text Limit**: Expanded from 1500 to 3000 characters for better context
- **Added Personalization Tracking**: Questions now include a `personalization` field explaining how they relate to the candidate's background
- **Fixed OpenAI API Format**: Corrected from incorrect `responses.create` to proper `chat.completions.create`

**Key Improvements:**
```javascript
// Before: Generic prompt
const systemPrompt = `You are an expert technical interviewer...`;

// After: Personalization-focused prompt
const systemPrompt = `You are an expert technical interviewer...
CRITICAL: You must analyze the candidate's resume thoroughly and generate questions that are SPECIFICALLY tailored to their unique background, projects, companies, and experiences.

Guidelines:
- Reference specific technologies, projects, or companies mentioned in the resume
- Ask about challenges they likely faced in their specific roles
- Make questions unique to their career path and expertise level`;
```

### 2. Enhanced Resume Analysis (`aiService.js`)

**Changes Made:**
- **Expanded Analysis Fields**: Now extracts `uniqueDetails`, `projectTypes`, and `industryContext`
- **Increased Token Limits**: More detailed analysis with higher token allowances
- **Better Company/Project Extraction**: Improved regex patterns for extracting specific details
- **Focus on Concrete Experiences**: Emphasizes actual accomplishments over generic skills

### 3. Improved Resume Insights Merging (`resumeInsights.js`)

**Changes Made:**
- **Added New Fields Support**: Handles `uniqueDetails`, `projectTypes`, and `industryContext`
- **Better Focus Hint Generation**: Creates more specific interview focuses based on actual resume content

### 4. Enhanced Question Selection Logic (`questionService.js`)

**Changes Made:**
- **Retry Mechanism**: AI question generation now has retry logic (up to 2 attempts)
- **Better Fallback Logic**: Improved template selection based on resume-specific insights
- **Enhanced Focus Hints**: Uses unique details and project types for better question targeting

### 5. API Error Handling

**Changes Made:**
- **Corrected API Format**: Fixed OpenAI API calls to use standard format
- **Better Error Messages**: More informative error handling and logging
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: System still works when AI is unavailable

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- All candidates received similar generic questions
- Questions like "Explain React hooks" regardless of experience level
- No reference to candidate's actual work experience

### After Fix:
- **Google Frontend Developer**: Gets questions about React performance optimization at scale, team leadership challenges, e-commerce architecture decisions
- **Netflix Backend Engineer**: Gets questions about microservices handling massive traffic, streaming data pipeline design, database optimization strategies
- Each question references specific companies, projects, or technologies from their resume

## Testing Verification

The fix includes comprehensive testing that shows:
1. ✅ Company-specific context extraction works
2. ✅ Project-specific experience identification works
3. ✅ Unique details are captured and utilized
4. ✅ Industry context influences question generation
5. ✅ Different resumes produce different personalization factors

## Files Modified

1. `/backend/src/services/aiService.js` - Core AI question generation logic
2. `/backend/src/utils/resumeInsights.js` - Resume analysis and merging
3. `/backend/src/services/questionService.js` - Question selection and retry logic
4. `/backend/src/services/interviewService.js` - Enhanced metadata handling

## How It Works Now

1. **Resume Upload**: System extracts comprehensive details (companies, projects, technologies, experience level)
2. **AI Analysis**: Enhanced prompt generates questions specifically referencing candidate's background
3. **Personalization**: Questions ask about actual challenges they faced in their specific roles
4. **Fallback**: Even without AI, improved template selection uses resume insights
5. **Uniqueness**: Each candidate gets questions tailored to their career path

## Sample Results

**Frontend Developer at Google (5 years React)**:
- "Given your experience leading the 8-person team at Google Shopping, how would you approach scaling React component architecture when multiple teams need to contribute?"

**Backend Engineer at Netflix (7 years Node.js)**:
- "Considering your work on Netflix's streaming architecture handling 100M+ requests/day, walk me through how you would design a caching strategy for a new real-time feature?"

The questions are now **unique**, **relevant**, and **tailored** to each candidate's actual experience and background.
